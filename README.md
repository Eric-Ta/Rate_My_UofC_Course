# Rate My UofC Course


For this project, I (alongside a group of 3 others) developed a course rating website for the University of Calgary. <br />
We used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, NodeJS, and MongoDB to create this application. The front-end was primarily designed using figma, and we extracted the CSS from it and implemented it into our application 

# Getting Started
